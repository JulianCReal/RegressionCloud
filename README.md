## Description
---
This laboratory explores the modeling of stellar luminosity through linear and polynomial regression techniques developed from first principles, without the use of pre-built machine learning libraries. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of how prediction models are constructed by explicitly defining the hypothesis function, the cost function, and the gradient-based optimization process, using observational stellar data as a case study.

The work is conducted within the framework of a Machine Learning bootcamp and emphasizes the importance of understanding model construction and execution in cloud-based and enterprise-level systems, where machine learning is increasingly treated as a core architectural capability rather than a black-box tool.

**Prerequisitos:**
- Python 3.8 or higher (As a recomendation, the newer versions are better due to the compatibility with the creations of virtual environments in multiple IDEs)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- libraries:
